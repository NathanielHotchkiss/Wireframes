# Wireframes

Built Figma Wireframes for a social media/collaboration platform concept. A client through Upwork provided hand drawn designs, I turned them into digital wireframes. This was my first time creating content on Figma, and I had a blast working on it. I designed 12 pages in total, each featuring a desktop design and a mobile design.
